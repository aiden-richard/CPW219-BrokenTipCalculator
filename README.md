# BrokenTipCalc-Start
For this project you will debug and fix an app that has some existing errors. Click the "Use this template" green button and create a copy of
this repo in your own account. Clone your copy of the repo.

## Requirements
- .NET 9 and VS 2022

## Tasks
- Compile the program and/or use the Error list window to fix any syntax issues
- Run the app and fix any runtime issues you encounter
- Use breakpoints and debugging to determine where the code is calculating incorrectly (don't just look at the code to find this, use breakpoints and actually debug the app)
- Use the browser Developer Tools to fix the CSS issue that is making the labels not show up correctly
